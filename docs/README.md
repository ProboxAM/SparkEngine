# Guild Master

Guild Master is a fantasy game where the player takes control of a collective of heroes who are part of a brotherhood. The player needs to recruit members for the guild, whom will be able to produce different type of resources. These resources will be used as provisions to send the members to the Dungeon, on different kind of quests, to increase their success chance.
These Dungeon quests will reward the player with special resources used to upgrade the guild buildings like the hall or blacksmith, allowing access to more members and improvements for them. 

The end goal is to defeat the Final Quest at day 5 or else the game will end in Defeat.

The player can assign provisions to the quest to increase success chance and allow Members to heal stamina during it.
At the end of a quest, each member with 0 stamina has a great chance of dying and be removed from the game completely.

## AI Archetypes

Every agent follows this Behaviour tree, When resting and when they are in quest they do the same, but every agent has it's own FSM when working nested in their Behaviour tree.

When resting, the agents recover stamina.

While daylight agents have a 25% of going to 4 different places:

* The market: agent walks around the market and visits 4 diferent spots randomly.
* Fishing: agent walks to the fishing spot, picks a fishing pole and starts fishing.
* The tavern: agent walks to the tavern and enters.
* Walk: agent goes for a walk and visit random spots in the map while chilling.

While night agent has a 55% chance of going to sleep and rest % is divided between the rest of the options above.

When in quest, the agent moves to the dungeon and enters in it, when the quest is complete they apear again.
