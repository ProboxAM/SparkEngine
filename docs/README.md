### Guild Master

Guild Master is a fantasy game where the player takes control of a collective of heroes who are part of a brotherhood. The player needs to recruit members for the guild, whom will be able to produce different type of resources. These resources will be used as provisions to send the members to the Dungeon, on different kind of quests, giving them various benefits. These Dungeon quests will reward the player with special resources used to upgrade the guild buildings like the hall or blacksmith, allowing access to more members and improvements for them. The end goal is to defeat the boss of the dungeon before the day limit.
